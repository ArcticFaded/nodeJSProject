Welcome to Grabbit! This is the project which was built for a hackathon

Grabbit is a geo-fencing application which allows sharing of files based on your current location! You can upload a file to our application and set a limit on how far you want your file to be shareable.

To run this project:

git clone https://github.com/ArcticFaded/nodeJSProject.git

npm update or npm install

node server

Thats it! your up and running (this app will be hosted at localhost on port 3000)
